    /**
A Finite State Machine System based on Chapter 3.1 of Game Programming Gems 1 by Eric Dybsand
 
Written by Roberto Cezar Bianchini, July 2010
 
 
How to use:
	1. Place the labels for the transitions and the states of the Finite State System
	    in the corresponding enums.
 
	2. Write new class(es) inheriting from FSMState and fill each one with pairs (transition-state).
	    These pairs represent the state S2 the FSMSystem should be if while being on state S1, a
	    transition T is fired and state S1 has a transition from it to S2. Remember this is a Deterministic FSM. 
	    You can't have one transition leading to two different states.
 
	   Method Reason is used to determine which transition should be fired.
	   You can write the code to fire transitions in another place, and leave this method empty if you
	   feel it's more appropriate to your project.
 
	   Method Act has the code to perform the actions the NPC is supposed do if it's on this state.
	   You can write the code for the actions in another place, and leave this method empty if you
	   feel it's more appropriate to your project.
 
	3. Create an instance of FSMSystem class and add the states to it.
 
	4. Call Reason and Act (or whichever methods you have for firing transitions and making the NPCs
	     behave in your game) from your Update or FixedUpdate methods.
 
	Asynchronous transitions from Unity Engine, like OnTriggerEnter, SendMessage, can also be used, 
	just call the Method PerformTransition from your FSMSystem instance with the correct Transition 
	when the event occurs.
